<p>There will be two projects that you will be evaluated on:  Both projects will require you to use what you have learnt so far:  HTML, BootStrap, JQuery and NodeJS

first project is a simple one(its academic):  You need to create a journal, like a diary.
 
Write an application that simulates a journal. A journal is essentially a list of entries. Make sure that you can do all of the following things:

<ol>
<li>1) Create a journal. </li> 
<li>2) When you create it, it should have no entries.</li>
<li>3) Create an entry. </li>
<li>4) Each entry should have a title, content, and an author.</li>
<li>5) Add an entry to your journal.</li>
<li>6) Display all the entries in your journal. </li>
</ol>

Once the the appropriate functions have been created and you can add and display your journal entries in the console, create a UI for your journal using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. You should be able to view and manipulate the journal from your browser instead of using the console. Try and make your journal look as appealing as possible!

<span> First do from the console, and then you need to do from the browser. </span>

 
These would be the learning objectives from this project:
<ol>
<li>1) Identify what objects to write based on a written problem</li>
<li>2) Identify what functions belong to what objects</li>
<li>3) Practice thinking about objects</li>
<li>4) Practice building objects.</li>
</ol>
